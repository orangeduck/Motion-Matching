# Code vs Data Driven Displacement

This repo contains the source code for all the demos from [this article](https://theorangeduck.com/page/code-vs-data-driven-displacement).

It uses [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) or more specifically [raygui](https://github.com/raysan5/raygui) so if you have that installed it should be easy to play around and out.

The data required if you want to regenerate the database is from from [this dataset](https://github.com/ubisoft/ubisoft-laforge-animation-dataset) which is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License (unlike the code, which is licensed under MIT).
